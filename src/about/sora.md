## About Sora Modules

Sora's modular architecture allows developers to create and integrate their own modules easily. Each module can define its own content sources, user interface components, and settings, making it simple to customize the app to your liking.

Sora modules are written in JavaScript and can be hosted on any web server. They can be shared with the community, allowing users to discover and install new content sources easily.

We have a collection of modules available for you to explore and use. You can find them in the [Module Library](https://library.cufiy.net/).
