## 🚦 Quick Overview

Every Sora module script must export four async functions:

| Function           | Input                | Output         | Purpose                                 |
|--------------------|--------------------- |--------------- |-----------------------------------------|
| [`searchResults`](/modules/module-functions/searchResults.md)    | `keyword` (string)   | JSON array     | Search for content by keyword           |
| [`extractDetails`](/modules/module-functions/extractDetails.md)   | `url` (string)       | JSON object    | Get details for a specific item         |
| [`extractEpisodes`](/modules/module-functions/extractEpisodes.md)  | `url` (string)       | JSON array     | List episodes for a show/movie          |
| [`extractStreamUrl`](/modules/module-functions/extractStreamUrl.md) | `url` (string)       | URL (string)   | Get the direct stream URL               |


## ⚡ Async JavaScript Mode

In **async JavaScript mode**, Sora:
- Calls `searchResults` with only the search keyword.
- Calls the other three functions with only the target URL.

**Each function must return data in the required format.**

### Other JavaScript Modes

Sora does support other JavaScript modes, but they are not recommended. Async mode is the most efficient and straightforward way to build Sora modules.

If you still want to use other modes, you can find more information in the [legacy documentation](/modules/legacy-documentation).

<!-- 
## 📝 Tips & Best Practices

- Always return data in the expected format (see table above).
- Use `try/catch` to handle errors gracefully and return fallback values.
- Use `encodeURIComponent` for user input in URLs.
- Test your module with real data before publishing.
- Log errors to help with debugging.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

- **Nothing shows up in Sora?**
    - Check your function names and return formats.
    - Make sure your script is accessible at the `scriptUrl` in your module JSON.
- **Errors in the console?**
    - Use `console.log` to debug and check for typos or network issues. -->
