### 💻 Software
- **[Sora App](https://sora.jm26.net/)**: Make sure the Sora app is installed and ready to go on your device.
- **Text Editor**: Use your favorite editor (like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), or [Atom](https://atom.io/)) to write and edit module files.
- **Web Browser**: Any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.) for testing and debugging. (But you probably already using one!)
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** *(optional)*: Recommended for testing scripts.
- **Git & GitHub** *(optional)*: For version control and sharing your modules with the community.

### 📚 Knowledge
- **JavaScript**: Essential for writing and editing module scripts.
- **HTML & Web Scraping**: Helpful for extracting data from websites.
- **Programming Logic**: Basic understanding will make module development easier.

## ✨ Creating Your First Module

1. **Create a new folder**  
    Name it after the source you want to add (e.g., `MySource`).

2. **Add a `module.json` file**  
    Inside your new folder, create a file named `module.json`. This file will define your module’s settings and metadata.

3. **Start Coding the Module**  
    Begin writing your module logic using JavaScript. You can add more files as needed.
